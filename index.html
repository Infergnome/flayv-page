        <h1>Welcome to the wacky world of the Flayv</h1>

        <p>This website is gonna be super badass.<br>
            We're gonna have flames up at the top, and probably really oddly constrasting background and text colors.<br>
            For now though it's just bare ass HTML because idk wtf I'm doing.<br>
            Luckily, this is the exact kind of webpage that you make by figuring it out as you go.
